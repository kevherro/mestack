# Experience first

The user is whoever consumes the work: end user, caller of an API,
or the next maintainer. When a cheaper implementation hurts that
person, take the better experience.

Ship fewer finished surfaces rather than more rough ones. Details
in the core loop beat extra options around it. If neither the
consumer nor the next maintainer would notice, drop it.
