# Reversible without asking

If the user can reject the result (a local edit, a draft, a
worktree), do it and present the result. Do not ask "should I?"

Still stop for irreversible actions: force-push to a shared branch,
production deploy, data deletion, messages to other people.

When the user said they are leaving, treat the leave-running contract
as the permission set. Do not invent extra gates.
