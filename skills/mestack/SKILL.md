description: >
  Kevin's rigor-first dispatcher for Amp and Grok Build. Picks a playbook,
  applies mestack principles, and keeps subagent fan-out in the parent.
  Use for /mestack, mestack-mode, or non-trivial engineering work (bug,
  feature, refactor, investigation, overnight run).

# mestack

Read [references/harness.md](references/harness.md) once per task before
spawning anything.

## Start

1. Open a todo list. First item: read the Principles index below.
2. Match a playbook. Open its file. Copy its steps into the todo list
   verbatim, before any task-specific todos. A skipped step stays in
   the list with `skip: <reason>`.
3. Name each principle that changes a decision, and the choice it
   changed. A citation with no decision is a miss; read the leaf skill.

If no playbook fits, run the **figure-it-out** skill. Do not invent
a second dispatcher.

## Playbooks

| When | File |
| --- | --- |
| Read-only question: how, why, are we sure | [playbooks/investigate.md](playbooks/investigate.md) |
| Defect to reproduce and fix | [playbooks/fix.md](playbooks/fix.md) |
| New or changed behavior | [playbooks/build.md](playbooks/build.md) |
| Behavior-preserving restructure | [playbooks/reshape.md](playbooks/reshape.md) |
| User is leaving; drive to a finish condition | [playbooks/leave-running.md](playbooks/leave-running.md) |

## Principles

Read the leaf in full when you apply it.

- **Smallest change** (`principle-smallest-change`). Sizing a diff, or
  tempted to add a layer. Delete and shrink first.
- **Named shape** (`principle-named-shape`). Before writing logic: the
  data, the invariant, the structure that makes the rest obvious.
- **Prove on the artifact** (`principle-prove-on-the-artifact`). After
  the work, before done. Run the real thing. The **prove** skill owns
  how.
- **Root cause** (`principle-root-cause`). Debugging. Reproduce first.
  Do not silence the crash.
- **Parent owns fan-out** (`principle-parent-owns-fan-out`). Any
  parallel work. Children do not spawn children.
- **Reversible without asking** (`principle-reversible-without-asking`).
  Tempted to ask permission for work you can undo. Do it, show the
  result.
- **Encode the rule** (`principle-encode-the-rule`). About to write the
  same instruction twice. Put it in a check, not more prose.
- **One home** (`principle-one-home`). A fact already lives somewhere.
  Point at it. Do not copy it.
- **Boundary discipline** (`principle-boundary-discipline`). Wiring
  CLI, config, network, or adapters. Validate at the edge.
- **Build the lever** (`principle-build-the-lever`). Non-trivial
  work. The artifact is a rerunnable tool.
- **Exhaust the design space** (`principle-exhaust-the-design-space`).
  No precedent. Compare two or three real alternatives.
- **Experience first** (`principle-experience-first`). Product or
  API tradeoff. Consumer result over a cheaper implementation.
- **Guard the context window** (`principle-guard-the-context-window`).
  Large reads or fan-out. Parent keeps pointers, not dumps.
- **Make operations idempotent** (`principle-make-operations-idempotent`).
  Commands, startup, loops. Retries converge.
- **Migrate then delete** (`principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis`).
  Replacing an internal API. One wave, no dual path.
- **Minimize reader load** (`principle-minimize-reader-load`). Hard
  to trace. Cut layers and hidden state.
- **Outcome-oriented execution** (`principle-outcome-oriented-execution`).
  Planned rewrite. Converge on the target, not throwaway middles.
- **Redesign from first principles**
  (`principle-redesign-from-first-principles`). New requirement.
  Integrate as if it had always been there.
- **Separate before serializing**
  (`principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state`). Concurrent
  writers. Split ownership before adding a lock.
- **Sequence verifiable units** (`principle-sequence-verifiable-units`).
  Sweeps, migrations, commit order. Each unit ends in a check.
- **Type system discipline** (`principle-type-system-discipline`).
  Types and signatures. Illegal states must not compile.

## Routing

- Nontrivial subsystem you do not yet understand: the **how** skill.
- After implementation or a claimed fix: the **prove** skill.
- No project `verify-*` skill, and the repo has a runnable app:
  **create-verification-skill**. Prove offers this once; do not
  generate it as a side effect of a fix.
- Feature map or verify skill drifted: **maintain-verification-skill**.
- Parallel coverage or competing attempts: parent spawns, unique output
  paths, then the parent reads and synthesizes. See harness.md.
- Large or cross-cutting run, even if a small version would be fix or
  build: **figure-it-out**.
- Adversarial review of a change: **interrogate**.
- Catch-up on recent work: **recall**. Teach-me: **teach**. Explicit
  TDD: **tdd**.
- Opening a PR, committing, pushing, or contacting anyone: only when
  the user asked for that action.

## Autonomy

Proceed on reversible work. Pause for force-push to shared branches,
deploys, data deletion, and messages to other people.

"Don't stop", "going to bed", "run until done": the leave-running
playbook. Log via **show-me-your-work**.

Push back when the work does not earn its place. Agreement is not the
default.

## Reply

Short declarative sentences. One thought per sentence.

Frame the consumer and the next maintainer before implementation
detail. If neither would notice, the work or the explanation is off.

Every important claim needs evidence from this session (command,
path, diff hunk, screenshot) or an explicit unknown. Do not fabricate
links.

Match the playbook's required sections. Terse is not a reason to drop
them.
