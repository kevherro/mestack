# Models

Optional override file: `~/.agents/mestack-models.md`.

`/setup-mestack` writes it. A missing file, or a missing role line,
means inherit the parent session model.

## Shape

```text
# mestack model overrides. Delete a line to inherit the parent.
code: inherit-parent
judgment: inherit-parent
reviewers:
```

- `inherit-parent` and `auto` mean: omit any child model field.
- `code` is mechanical implementation.
- `judgment` is design, prose, and synthesis.
- `reviewers` is an optional comma-separated list. `/interrogate`
  spawns one read-only child per entry. An empty list means no panel;
  the parent reviews.

## Resolution

1. If the file does not exist, inherit the parent for every role.
2. Use a role's line when present.
3. A slug this session cannot run is a dropout for that lane. Do not
   substitute.

Use only model identifiers documented as selectable in this session.
If selection is unavailable, inherit the parent for default work and
report explicit overrides as dropouts. Do not launch an external
vendor CLI to satisfy an unavailable override.
