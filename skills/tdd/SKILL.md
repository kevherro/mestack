# TDD

Make the broken behavior executable before changing production code.
Skip a new test when the path is expensive, integration-heavy, or
not requested, and say so.

A mestack **fix** still starts with a repro on the real surface.
This skill is the loop when that repro is a cheap test.

## Steps

1. Name intended vs current behavior and the smallest observation.
2. Pick the narrowest check this repo already uses for that path.
   If none is cheap, do not invent a heavy harness to satisfy TDD.
3. Write the failing test first. It encodes intended behavior, not
   the current implementation.
4. Run it. It must fail for the intended reason. If it passes, or
   fails for a different reason, fix the test before production code.
5. Smallest production change that makes the intent hold
   (**smallest-change**, **root-cause**).
6. Run the same test. It must pass.
7. Run nearby tests. Then **prove** on the real artifact when that
   artifact is not this test.

## If a failing test is not practical

Say why. Use the closest executable check (script, command, UI
drive). Prefer no new test over a mock-heavy or timing-dependent
one.

Do not weaken assertions to match a wrong implementation.

**Reply:** failing-before command and output, passing-after command
and output, nearby checks. If failing-before was impossible, why
and what you ran instead.
