# Parent owns fan-out

The top-level session launches every child. A child never launches
another child. Keep task ownership and synthesis in the session
that holds the user’s goal, even when nested delegation is supported.

Give each writer a unique worktree or output directory. Shared
mutable paths across siblings are a bug.

The parent reads the artifacts and writes the summary. Child
self-reports are untrusted.
