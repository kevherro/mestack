# Generated `verify-<slug>` skill

The file `<repo>/.agents/skills/verify-<slug>/SKILL.md` is for a cold
agent mid-task. No placeholders. Every command, port, selector, and
path must be one this repo actually uses.

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: verify-<slug>
description: >
  Drive <app> (<surface>) the way a user does and capture proof.
  Use when proving a change to <app>, or when /prove needs this
  repo's harness.
---
```

`name` must match the directory.

## Required sections

### Launch

Exact command that starts the app for verification. How to know it is
ready (log line, port, prompt). Env vars, ports, seed data, auth.
Teardown of what this run started.

A short-lived CLI has no server: launch means build or install once,
then each drive gets its own process.

### Doctor

One read-only check: is this instance worth driving? Process up, right
binary, port owned by this run, auth valid. Run doctor first whenever
anything looks off.

### Drive

How an agent operates the surface. Prefer an existing harness
(Playwright, expect, curl, a repo script). Only then a generic recipe
(browser for web/Electron, PTY for CLI/TUI, HTTP for a service).

Use stable handles from this repo: ARIA labels, `data-` attributes,
prompt strings, route paths, subcommands. Not coordinates or "hit Tab
six times".

### Evidence

What to capture and where it goes (directory named in the skill).
Proof standards:

- Exercise the real user path, not a test-only back door.
- Capture the action and the resulting state, not only the last
  screen.
- Check side effects (files, rows, messages) as well as what is
  visible.
- If the safe path is dry-run or test mode, observe what it actually
  skips (network, files, git refs). Do not trust the flag's name.

Evidence survives cleanup.

### Cleanup

Tear down instances and scratch this run created. Kill what you
started, not "whatever matches this process name". Do not delete
evidence.

### Helpers

Any script in the skill directory is executable. The skill body shows
the invocation. A helper the reader has to reverse-engineer is not a
helper.

### Feature map

Point at `features/README.md` in the same skill directory. A proof
that drives one convenient entry point is incomplete when the map
lists others that apply.

## Isolation

Say whether two instances can run side by side (ports, data dirs,
profiles). If they cannot, the skill must refuse to double-drive a
shared instance the user already has open.
