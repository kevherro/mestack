# Migrate callers, then delete

When a new internal API is the design, move every in-tree caller
and delete the old one in the same wave. Dual paths are not a
compatibility strategy for code you own.

Time-box an adapter only when an external user still needs the
old surface. Update tests to the new contract. Delete tests that
only protected the previous shape.
